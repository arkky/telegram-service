# Telegram service

At this point in time, I have not finished it yet. The logic of the telegram service is simple:
1) The user wants to use the parsing service for some other service (discord, website, social networks, etc.) and enters this bot
2) He replenishes his account with cryptocurrency or fiat currency
3) Selects the parsing service he needs
4) On the backend side, the service is parsed according to the specified parameters and returns the result to him
5) Everyone is happy
